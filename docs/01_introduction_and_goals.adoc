== Introduction and Goals

****
DeChat is a decentralized messaging application developed using the https://solid.mit.edu[Solid] platform.
It will let any user with a Secure Pod chat with his trusted contacts, guaranteeing the privacy of the conversation.
****

=== Requirements Overview

Right now, there exist many kinds of messaging applications, but all of them follow a centralized architecture. This is, all the data must go through a server, compromising its security and privacy.

Our main goal is to keep user's data private, and letting the user share it with only with the people he trusts. That's why we will use the Solid platform to create a decentralized chat application able to reach these standards.

Now, if we are using this platform to build our app, the project requirements will be based on the https://github.com/solid/solid-spec[Solid specification].
Here are the basic ones we have decided to define for DeChat:

- The application will follow a decentralized architecture, storing the data in the Solid PODs
- DeChat will allow a user to chat with his trusted contacts, and share pictures or videos, as well as other kind of media.
- Users can create group chats, in which two or more contacts will send messages to all the members of the group.
- The user data will be always kept private and secure.

|Problem|Solution

|Build a decentralized application. 
|As we said just before, we can make it private by means of the use of the PODS. 

|The users must have the total control of their own data 
|We will create local repositories with PODS. 

|The user can send multimedia like pictures, video... 
|We will recode different kind of chats to include our technology. 

|The user will receive a notification when someone wants to chat with him. 
|We will ask for notification permission in the device to add an extension. 

|Users can have groups with people they want to chat with. 
In the groups, the whole group will receive the message. 
|With PODS we will create repositories in each device also with group chats.

=== Stakeholders

[options="header"]
|===
|Role|Expectations
| Solid development team | They are the original proposers of the project, and are interested in the best results of this and the ones of other teams of this course, as the best ones will be presented for public review and maybe used in the final product. For more information, see https://solid.mit.edu/.
| Teachers of the cousrse| They expect a well developed final version following some specific guidelines, paying special attention to the architecture of the project, due to this being the main topic of the subject.
| Software developers | They expect to develop a well-built application, which covers te specifications given, has a good architecture well documented, and the functionalities it has work as they are expected.
| Documentation authors | They expect to document as it is said, the architecture of the application, adapting it to the format specified by the teachers of the course.
| Application users | They expect the application to be easy to use, to have a good user interface, and that the functionalities that are said to belong to the application, to work in a proper way.
| Ethics supervisor | It is expected for the application to cover some ethics principles, for example, to respect the users privacy, and so on.
| Software Architects | They expect to build the architecture that fits the best to the specification required by the project proposers, trying to make the best decisions for achieving the desired goal.
