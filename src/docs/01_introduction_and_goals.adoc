[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

=== Requirements Overview

Requirements Overview  

.Context 

-We have an application chat like, with some extensions like voice call, video call... This app won't have a central server, so it must be made by pods. LINKS 

We must use javaScript because we must use SOLID 

  

.Motivation 

-There are many chat applications that have an open server, but in our case, we want that the information shared by the users can be only managed by themselves. We think that the private way of chatting is a needed improve, because nowadays, the privacy is one of the main keys in internet, because we don't really know who can see our things. 

Making the application private will change the behaviour of the user-user connection 

  

.Form 

-DeChat´s goal is to be a user-user interaction platform with a higher security, thanks to a server that is decentralized. 

-How can we make that possible? 

+That’s possible because of PODS.   

Problem 

Solution 

Build a decentralized application. 

As we said just before, we can make it private by means of the use of the PODS. 

The users must have the total control of their own data 

We will create local repositories with PODS. 

The user can send multimedia like pictures, video... 

We will recode different kind of chats to include our technology. 

The user will receive a notification when someone wants to chat with him. 

We will ask for notification permission in the device to add an extension. 

Users can have groups with people they want to chat with. 

With PODS we will create repositories in each device also with group chats. 

In the groups, the whole group will receive the message.

|===
|Quality goal
|Scenario
|Priority

|Usability
|A user should be able to select a contact and start the conversation in less than 
5 seconds.
|High, High

|Performance efficiency
|The message should be sent and stored in the other user's POD in less than 2 
seconds.
|High, Medium

|Security
|In case of a network failure, the system should notify the user about having 
no connection in less than 4 seconds.
|High, Low

|Testability
|When testing a piece of the design, we should be able to finish in less than 
3 days.
|Medium, High

|Usability
|If a user deletes a message by accident, the system should be able to recover it 
in less than 5 seconds.
|Medium, Low

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

|Role|Names|Expectations
| Solid development team | Tim Berners Lee, Mitzi Lazslo, etc | They are the original proposers of the project, and are interested in the best results of this and the ones of other teams of this course, as the best ones will be presented for public review and maybe used in the final product. For more information, see https://solid.mit.edu/.
| Teachers of the cousrse| Jose Emilio Labra Gayo, Noelia Rico Pachón, etc | They expect a well developed final version following some specific guidelines, paying special attention to the architecture of the project, due to this being the main topic of the subject.
| Software developers | Hugo Fonseca Díaz, Paco Juan Quiros, etc | They expect to develop a well-built application, which covers te specifications given, has a good architecture well documented, and the functionalities it has work as they are expected.
| Documentation authors | The whole team | They expect to document as it is said, the architecture of the application, adapting it to the format specified by the teachers of the course.
| Application users | Anyone | They expect the application to be easy to use, to have a good user interface, and that the functionalities that are said to belong to the application, to work in a proper way.
| Ethics supervisor | Mitzi Lazslo | It is expected for the application to cover some ethics principles, for example, to respect the users privacy, and so on.
| Software Architects | The developers team | They expect to build the architecture that fits the best to the specification required by the project proposers, trying to make the best decisions for achieving the desired goal.
