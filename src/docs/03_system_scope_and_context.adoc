== System Scope and Context
:imagesdir: images


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

The application will be divided in several modules, each one with a different responsability.

[options="header"]
|===
|Module|Responsabilities|Relations
|Login Service|Will verify the user identity and grant him access to the app.|The verification process will use the Solid API.
|Messaging Service|This module will let the user write any message, and then send the data to the necessary number of PODs in the Solid platform.|It will have a direct communication with Solid PODs.
|Solid Platform|We will use it to securely store the user's data in a decentralized way.|

Right now the project is in a very early stage. This page will be modified during the development process.
