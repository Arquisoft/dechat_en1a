== Design Decisions

The app code is distributed in a modular way (see document 5 "building-block-view", level 1 and 2, for a more detailed insight), being all the classes in the same package level, and interacting between one another, taking a part in the construction of the app, in a more "graphical design" sense, and each one having very concrete functions.
For the main structuration of the architecture we have based it on angular using a template provided by it. The main programing languale for the logic is TypeScript, and for the graphical aspect CSS and HTML mainly.
Testing is implemented using Karma, also provided by angular templates, and for the user stories Cucumber was used.
